The Perf Event Testsuite
  by Vince Weaver   <vincent.weaver _at_ maine.edu>


This series of test is meant to validate that the perf_event
subsystem is working.


QUICKSTART
~~~~~~~~~~
  1. run "make"
  2. run "./run_tests.sh"

  If a test fails you can run the individual test to get more info on
  why.

CROSS COMPILE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. make sure that the cross compiler toolchain is in PATH
  2. run "make CROSS_COMPILE=<compiler name>"

  e.g., "make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-"


LAYOUT
~~~~~~
There are various subdirectories:

   + crashes   -- these contain tests known to crash certain
                  kernel versions from userspace.
                  * USE CAUTION RUNNING THESE TESTS *

   + exploits  -- perf_event code that can cause some sort of security exploit

   + fuzzer    -- a fuzzer tool that tries to hit the extremes of
                  the perf_event interface and find bugs in the kernel

   + include   -- common include files

   + lib       -- common library code

   + papi      -- tests for the PAPI library.  Only compile/run
                  these if you have PAPI installed

   + perf_event_h -- an archive of perf_event.h files over the
                     history of the interface.  Useful when
                     figuring out when a feature was added

   + results   -- results of ./run_tests.sh across kernel versions

   + tests     -- all of the various tests live under here

   + tools     -- various perf_event related tools
